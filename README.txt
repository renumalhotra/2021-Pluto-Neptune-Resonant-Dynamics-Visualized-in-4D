This GitHub directory contains the python code used to generate rotating frame plots and animations to visualize the orbital evolution of the Pluto-Neptune mean motion resonance in 3D+time. With a few small changes, this code can be used to study other MMR systems. The contents of this directory are as follows

- 3body.py : this python script is used to integrate (with the orbit integrator, REBOUND) the 3 body problem of the Sun, Neptune and Pluto, save the cartesian coordinates (both rotated and non-rotated) at intervals of 5 years to a text file [state the name of this file and where located]

- make_frames.py : this python script reads in the text file generated by 3body.py and creates (x,y) (y,z) (x,z) and (x,y,z) plots in the rotating frame these are saved to the subdirectory '/tmp_frames'

- animator.py : this python script reads in all the individual frames from /tmp_frames and combines them to create an animation of the orbital evolution [state the type, name of this file and where located]. It deletes the contents of /tmp_frames once the animation is saved

- tmp_frames : the subdirectory where animation frames are temporarily saved

- Examples : this subdirectory contains example plots and animations for the Pluto-Neptune system visualized in (x,y) (y,z) (x,z) and (x,y,z) in the rotating frame of Neptune, for a total period of 40,000 years.
