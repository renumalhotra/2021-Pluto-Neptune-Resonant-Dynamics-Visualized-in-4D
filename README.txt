This GitHub directory contains the python code used to generate rotating frame plots and animations to visualize the orbits of the Pluto-Neptune mean motion resonant system. This code can be modified with a few small changes in code to study other MMR systems. The contents of this directory are as follows

- 3body.py : this python script is used to integrate a 3body problem in rebound, save the cartesian coordinates (both rotated and non-rotated) to a text file, and create rotating frame plots in (x,y) (y,z) (x,z) and (x,y,z)

- make_frames.py : this python script reads in the text file generated by 3body.py and creates the frames used to turn these static plots into animations that show the bodies moving along their orbits. the frames are saved to the subdirectory '/tmp_frames'

- animator.py : this python script reads in the frames from /tmp_frames and uses them to create an animation of the orbits in the MMR system. it also deletes the contents of /tmp_frames once the animation is saved

- tmp_frames : the subdirectory where animation frames are temporarily saved

- Examples : this subdirectory contains example plots and animations for the Pluto-Neptune system visualized in (x,y) (y,z) (x,z) and (x,y,z) in the rotating frame of Neptune
