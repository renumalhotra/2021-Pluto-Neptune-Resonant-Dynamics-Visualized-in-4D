This GitHub directory contains the python code used to generate rotating frame plots and animations to visualize the orbital evolution of the Pluto-Neptune mean motion resonance in 3D+time. With a few small changes, this code can be used to study other MMR systems. The contents of this directory are as follows

- 3body.py : this python script is used to integrate (with the orbit integrator, REBOUND) the 3 body problem of the Sun, Neptune, and Pluto, save the cartesian coordinates (both rotated and non-rotated) to a text file ('rebound_data.txt'), and create rotating frame plots in (x,y) (y,z) (x,z) and (x,y,z) (plots in './Examples')

- make_frames.py : this python script reads in the text file generated by 3body.py and creates the frames used to turn these static plots into animations that show the bodies moving along their orbits. the frames are saved to the subdirectory '/tmp_frames'

- animator.py : this python script reads in the frames from /tmp_frames and uses them to create an animation of the orbits in the MMR system. the filename can be specified by the user, and the animation will be saved to the main directory. this script also deletes the contents of /tmp_frames once the animation is saved

- tmp_frames : the subdirectory where animation frames are temporarily saved

- rebound_data.txt : this text file contains the rotated and non-rotated cartesian coordinates from the 3 body problem integrated in 3body.py

- Examples : this subdirectory contains example plots and animations for the Pluto-Neptune system visualized in (x,y) (y,z) (x,z) and (x,y,z) in the rotating frame of Neptune. there are also example plots for a near-MMR case where Pluto's semi major axis was increased by 1% to shift it out of MMR
